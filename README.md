RegexFA
=======

Theory of Computation mini project - 2014.

The purpose of this assignment is to write a program which will allow a regular expression and a string to be inputted. The
program should recognise whether the string is a member of the language which is denoted by the regular expression.

A regular expression has to be parsed and converted to an expression tree.
Using Thompsonâ€™s construction, the regular expression tree built must then be used to build an NFA accepting the language 
denoted by the regular expression.
Using the subset construction, the NFA built must then be converted to an equivalent DFA.
